It is more important that you really understand the root of the practice, and that you train patiently and perseveringly. Every piece has its own poem or song to explain the exercise and its purpose. The poems or songs have been passed down through generations, and form the root and foundation of each piece, so you should make a diligent effort to understand them. Whereas the sitting set emphasized the six Qi channels in the arms, the standing set works with all of the channels.

Here are three sets from the Standing Eight Pieces of Brocade: 

First Piece—Sanijiao “Triple Burner”

Double hands hold up the heavens to regulate the Sanjiao (Triple Burner); Sanjiao passes (Qi) freely and smoothly, illnesses disappear. Reverse hands to face the sky and raise both arms. Thrust out (straighten) your chest, straighten your waist (and) swing to both sides. Stand upright and be steady. Practice long, the body (becomes) strong (and you will feel) happy.

Practice: Stand naturally with your feet parallel and shoulder width apart, and your hands at your sides. Close your eyes, calm down your mind, and breathe regularly. Open your eyes and look forward, continue breathing naturally and smoothly. Condense your Shen in your Upper Dan Tian, and sink your Qi to the Lower Dan Tian. Then interlock your fingers and raise your hands above your head without bending your arms, and at the same time lift up your heels. This is called “Double hands hold up the heavens” (Shuang Shou Tuo Tian). Drop your heels, and tilt your body to the left and then to the right, and then stand up straight again. Lower your hands down in front of your body to complete one round. Do twenty-four repetitions.

Discussion: This set does not start with calm meditation, but since Qigong training is strongly related to your feelings, it is important for your mind to be calm and steady. It is a good idea to stand quietly for a while before you start, so that your mind can become calm.

From the poetry you can see that this piece works especially with the Sanjiao or Triple Burner. The three areas, or “burners,” that are referred to are the area above the diaphragm, between the diaphragm and navel, and between the navel and the groin. The three burners are concerned respectively with respiration, digestion, and elimination. When you raise your hands over your head and tilt to either side you stretch the muscles of your trunk. When you let your arms down, the muscles loosen and relax, and the Qi can circulate unimpeded. Repeating the movement regulates the Qi circulation in your Sanjiao. When Sanjiao Qi circulation is smooth, the organs will be relaxed, and the organ Qi will be able to move and circulate freely. It is believed that disorders in the Sanjiao are the major cause of many organ Qi disorders. When Sanjiao Qi is regulated, the illness will disappear.

When you practice, you also lift up your heels. This helps you to generate an Yi of pushing up, which helps the Sanjiao Qi move up and down. When they say to “straighten your waist” they mean to keep your lower back straight.



Second Piece—Shooting a Bow

Left right open (bend) the bow like shooting a hawk, two arms strong and firm to strengthen kidneys and waist. Bend the elbow horizontal to the shoulder, (your mind) trying hard to pull. Hand arrow aims (at the target), use the eyes to stare. Left right shoot for twenty-four. Ride the horse and squat down to increase efficiency.
Eight Pieces of Brocade

Practice: Step your right leg to the right and squat down in a horse stance. Relax your hands and lift them up to the chest area. Bring your palms together, then separate them with the right hand moving near the right nipple, while the left hand, changing into the “sword secret” or “single finger” hand form, extends to the left as if you were pulling a bow to shoot a hawk. Your eyes stare to your left at a very distant point. Then stand up and lower your hands, circle them up to the chest and repeat the same process to shoot to your right. Do twelve in either direction for a total of twenty-four.

Discussion: This piece is used to strengthen the kidneys and the waist area. First you must squat down to firm your root as when you pull a strong bow. Without this root, you will not have a center, and you will not be able to pull your bow effectively. Make sure when you squat down that you keep your back straight and tuck your buttocks under. This emphasizes the kidney area. When you are doing this, you not only strengthen the waist muscles, but also increase the Qi circulation in the kidney area, in your back near your lowest ribs. Your rear elbow must be bent and the shoulders must be firm to stabilize the pulling of the bow. Concentrate your mind so that you really feel that you are drawing a very strong bow. This concentrated mind is the source of the Qi movement.



Third Piece—Increase Qi in Internal Organs

To adjust and regulate the spleen and stomach, (you) must lift singly; spleen and stomach (gain) peace and harmony, sickness cured automatically. Lift arm and stiffen the palms, use the force to rock. Extend and develop the tendons and muscles, spleen and stomach comfortable. Right hand lifted high, left dropped down, left right extend and rock the tendons and channels alive.
Eight Pieces of Brocade

Practice: After you have completed the last piece, stand up and move your leg back so that the feet are parallel and shoulder width apart. Then move both hands to the front of your stomach with the palms facing up. Raise your left hand above your head and push upward, and at the same time lower your right hand palm down to your side and press down slightly. Then change your hands and repeat the same process. You should feel that both hands are pushing against resistance, but you must not tense your muscles. Do twenty-four repetitions.

Discussion: This piece works on the stomach. When you repeatedly raise one hand and lower the other, you loosen the muscles in the front of your body. When you “stiffen the palms,” do not tense the muscles, but rather extend your force through the hands so that your arms stretch out all the way. This stimulates and strengthens the tendons and muscles. Reversing your arms repeatedly stretches and relaxes the body, “rocking” the tendons and Qi channels alive. This one-up-and-one-down muscle movement increases the Qi circulation in your stomach, spleen, and liver. If you wish, when you raise and stretch each hand you can also stretch the leg on the same side to increase the extension.

Once yo9u become familiar with the Eight Pieces of Brocade, you will find that it is a very simple but effective way to maintain your health.  You may also notice that unlike the sets developed by doctors and monks, breath coordination is not essential in most of the pieces. The Eight Pieces follow a few simple principles, but they will lead the interested practitioner down the righ path to discover what Qi is all about, and will also improve your health.


Fourth Piece of the Standing Eight Pieces of Brocade

Translation of the Chinese Poem—Five Weaknesses and Seven Injuries

    Five weaknesses and seven injuries—wait and see later (they’ll be gone); train long, exercise long, tendons and bones strong. Weakness injuries (from -over-exertion) all because the internal organs (are) weak. Thrust out (straighten) the chest and twist the neck to take a good look to the rear. Hold the waist and hold up the chest; the body is upright. This is especially effective in curing internal injury. 

Five weaknesses refer to illnesses of the five yin organs: heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. The seven injuries refer to injuries caused by the seven emotions: happiness, anger, sorrow, joy, love, hate, and desire. According to Chinese medicine, you can become ill when your internal organs are weak and emotional disturbance upsets them. For example, anger can cause the qi in your liver to stagnate, which will affect the functioning of the organ.

But your organs are not the only things affected—strong emotions also cause qi to accumulate in your head. When you turn your head from side to side you loosen up the muscles, blood vessels, and qi channels in your neck and allow the qi in your head to smooth out. Additionally, since you are also training your feelings and shen to be centered and neutral, you will be able to avoid excessive or extreme emotions and their negative effects. In the form, you turn your head to look behind you, as if you were looking at all the negative things that you have left behind. It is important to look intently to the rear, so that the qi keeps moving. If you merely turn your head, the qi will stagnate in your neck. Practicing this piece regularly will regulate the qi in your organs and head, repairing the damage caused by strong emotions and helping you to avoid all illnesses.

The poem also implies that this piece can cure old injuries. When you practice, you use your mind to lead the qi from your lower dan tian to the bubbling well cavities, which smoothes out the qi circulation in your lower body. When you turn your head while holding your hands in the different positions, you slightly stretch different parts of the inside of your body and regulate the qi flow there. This will help to cure old internal injuries and bruises that cannot be easily reached by other methods of treatment.
Practice:  Fourth Piece

    Stand easily and comfortably with both feet parallel, and your hands hanging down naturally at your sides.  Lift your chest slightly from the inside so that your posture is straight, but be careful not to thrust your chest out.  Turn your head to the left and look to the rear as you exhale.
    Next return your head to the front as you inhale. Turn your head to the right and look to the rear as you exhale.  Return your head to the front as you inhale.  Turn twelve times in each direction, for a total of twenty-four.  Your body should remain facing to the front.  Do not turn your body as you turn your head.
    Place your hands on your waist.  Thumbs forward and fingertips point to your spine.
    Eight Pieces of Brocade Fourth Piece
    Turn your head to the left and look to the rear as you exhale.
    Return your head to the front as you inhale.  Turn your head to the right and look to the rear as you exhale. Return your head to the front as you inhale. Turn twelve times in each direction, for a total of twenty-four.  Your body should remain facing to the front. Do not turn your body as you turn your head.
    Move both hands to your chest with the palms facing up, press your elbows and shoulders slightly forward, and turn your head to the left as you exhale.
    Return your head to the front as you inhale. Turn your head to the right as you exhale. Return your head to the front as you inhale. Turn twelve times in each direction, for a total of twenty-four.  Your body should remain facing to the front. Do not turn your body as you turn your head.

During all three parts, use your yi to lead the qi from the lower dan tian to your bubbling well (yongquan, K-1) and huiyin cavities when you exhale and turn your head to either side, and then lead the qi back to the lower dan tian as you inhale and return your head to the front.



Fifth Piece of the Standing Eight Pieces of Brocade

Translation of the Chinese Poem—Sway the Head and Swing the Tail to get rid of the Heart Fire

    Translation: Sway the head and swing the tail to get rid of the heart fire. (When) the heart fire (is) strong, (use) the metal lung to subdue. Hands press the kneecaps,-repeatedly sway and swing. Blood flows smoothly, many good benefits. (If) the muscles/tendons are cramped, legs sore, (and) body numb, repeatedly extend and press heavily; do not waste time (hesitate). 

Fire (excessive qi) in the middle dan tian (zhong dan tian) at the solar plexus can be caused by improper food, breathing unhealthy air, or lack of sleep. This frequently causes heartburn. For this reason, it is called heart fire (xin huo). When excessive qi accumulates and stagnates in your middle dan tian or heart, the best course of action is to move this fire to the lungs where you can regulate it and put it out with smooth breathing.

According to the five elements theory, fire can destroy metal, but metal can also absorb the heat and control fire. The lungs belong to the element metal (see table), and the heart belongs to the element fire, and so it is said that the metal lungs can subdue the heart fire.

When you hold your hands on your knees with the thumbs to the rear, you are expanding your chest, and when you move your body from side to side, you are loosening up the lungs and therefore taking in the excess qi from the middle dan tian, and consequently putting out the fire. As you are doing this, you are also increasing the blood circulation, which will take care of any numbness or soreness in the legs.

 Make sure that when you lean to each side you don’t drop your head. Keep your head, neck, and spine in a line. When you “press heavily” on one knee, you compress the lung on that side and relax and open the lung on the other side. This works the two lungs like -bellows.
Practice: Fifth Piece

    From a natural standing position, step your right leg one step to the right and squat down in a horse stance.  Place your hands on top of your knees, with the thumbs on the outside of the thighs.  Your qi is sunk to the bottom of your feet, and your yi is on the two bubbling well cavities.
    Shift your weight to your left leg and press down heavily with your hand, and line up (extend) your head, spine and right leg.  Stay in this position for about three seconds.
    Eight Pieces of Brocade Fifth Piece

    Return to original position.
    Shift your weight to your right leg and press down heavily with your hand, and line up (extend) your head, spine and right leg.  Stay in this position for about three seconds.  Turn twelve times in each direction for a total of twenty-four repetitions.


Sixth Piece of the Standing Eight Pieces of Brocade

Translation of the Chinese Poem--Two Hands Hold the Feet

    Translation: Two hands hold the feet to strengthen the kidneys and waist; (when the) kidneys and waist are strong the entire body (is) strong. Bend the waist and hold the feet. (This is the) most effective way to strengthen the muscles/tendons and bones. One down one up, the life force greatly increases. (It is) the best way to prevent colds. 

The kidneys, which are beneath the two major back muscles, are the residence of original jing (yuan jing,). When the kidneys are healthy and strong, your original jing is retained and strengthened. Only when your kidneys are strong will they be able to generate original qi (yuan qi,) and enliven your body. When you bend forward and use your hands to hold your feet, you are tensing the back muscles and restricting the flow of qi in the area of the kidneys.

When you release this pressure, the qi flow will resume, removing any qi stagnation. This exercise is an excellent way to massage the kidneys and increase the flow of qi there, as well as in the back muscles and the spine itself. When the kidneys are strong, the original qi will be strong. When original qi is full and strong, your body will be able to generate a strong shield of guardian qi (wei qi,) to protect you from the cold.

When you are bent over you are lightly stressing your whole body, and in particular, you are stimulating your kidneys. When you straighten up and extend your arms, your mind is thinking of stretching out to your hands and feet. This action of the mind and body leads the qi out to all your tendons.

When you are bent over, part of your attention (and part of the qi from your kidneys) is drawn to your sacrum. The qi will enter the spine through the holes in the sacrum, and when you stand up it will pass through the spine. Eventually the qi will move through and vitalize your whole skeleton.
Eight Pieces of Brocade Sixth Piece

    Assume a natural standing posture with your feet shoulder-width apart.  Press both palms down slightly beside your waist.
    Move your hands up in front of your chest.
    Continue to move your hands above your head with the palms facing up.  Hold the posture for three seconds. The form looks as if you are holding or lifting something above your head.  Your mind is on your mingmen cavity (Gv-4) in the kidney area.
    Bend forward with the arms extended.
    Grab your toes and hold your feet.  Pull your hands up slightly so that you are putting a gentle stress on your whole body.  While holding your feet, your mind is on the bubbling well (Yongquan, K-1) cavity. Hold the posture for three seconds.  Perform the entire process sixteen times.


Seventh Piece of the Standing Eight Pieces of Brocade

Translation of the Chinese Poem—Screw the Fist with Fiery Eyes

    Screw the fist with fiery eyes to increase qi-li; body and mind healthy, the spirit of vitality comfortable. Ride the horse and squat down, straightening the chest. Hold the fist or strike with palm, using more force. Left and right, two hands grasp in turn. Grasp, hold, fiery eyes, use li-qi. 

Practice

This piece is very similar to the second piece.
Eight Pieces of Brocade Seventh Piece

    From a natural standing posture, step your right foot to the side and squat down in a horse stance, holding your body erect and your fists beside your waist.
    Tighten both fists, and extend one arm to the side in a twisting punch motion (screw the fist).  Your other hand stays beside your waist in a tight fist.  The hand that is out can be either a fist or an open palm. When you make the punching motion, glare fiercely at an imaginary opponent.
    After you finish the extending movement, loosen both hands and bring the extended hand back to your waist to the starting position.
    Repeat on the other side.  Tighten both fists, extend one arm to the side in a twisting punch motion (screw the fist). Your other hand stays beside your waist in a tight fist. The hand that is out can be either a fist or an open palm. When you make the punching motion, glare fiercely at an imaginary opponent. Do eight on both sides for a total of sixteen repetitions.

This piece trains you to raise your spirit of vitality. When your spirit is raised, you strengthen the qi flow and also increase your muscular strength (li). Muscular strength that is reinforced by qi is called qi-li or li-qi. As you raise your spirit (shen) and increase your qi-li, the qi will fill your body all the way out to the skin. In the other exercises, you have been focusing your attention and concentrating your qi. It is important to now do this piece because it clears out any stagnant qi and leads it to the skin. Concentrating your yi is the key to success. If you have a very strong mental image of punching someone very hard, your yi will lead your qi out to the ends of your arms and legs to make the punch powerful.


Eighth Piece of the Standing Pieces of Brocade
Translation of the Chinese Poem—Seven Disorders and Hundreds of Illnesses Disappear

    Seven disorders and hundreds of illnesses disappear and are left behind your back; hundreds of illnesses are caused because the body is weak. The feet up, achievement is hard to describe by pen. Keep the head up and press down to reach to the end of the toes. Hold the waist and hold the chest, up and down movements. (It is) effective in getting rid of sickness and eliminating disasters (illnesses). 

Practice
Eight Pieces of Brocade Eighth Piece

There are three parts to this exercise. The different hand positions serve different qi circulation functions.

    First, drop both hands down naturally, beside your body.  Stand still and keep your mind calm.  Rise up on your toes and stay as high as you can for three seconds, then lower your feet to the floor.  Perform the motion twenty-four times.
    Place your hands on your waist. Thumbs forward and fingertips pointing to your spine.
    Raise yourself up on your toes for three seconds and then let yourself down. Do this twenty-four times.
    Hold your hands in front of your chest.
    Raise yourself up on your toes for three seconds and then let yourself down. Do this twenty-four times.
    After you finish this piece, stand still, keep your mind calm, and breathe smoothly and regularly for about three minutes.

This piece is used to smooth out the qi from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet. When you raise yourself up on your toes, you are stimulating six of the qi channels, which are connected to internal organs. The three hand positions, which are the same as in the fourth piece, help to regulate the qi in different parts of your body.

In conclusion, Chinese qigong has a number of different styles, or schools, which come from different sources. One style, which was developed by scholars and is now practiced by the general populace, is devoted to maintaining health. A second style developed by Chinese doctors concentrates on healing. A third style was developed in the Buddhist and Daoist religions to help the devotees reach the goal of immortality. This style seeks not only to improve and maintain health, but also to lengthen life.

Once you become familiar with the Eight Pieces of Brocade, you will find that it is a very simple, but effective way to maintain your health. You may also notice that, unlike the sets developed by doctors and monks, breath coordination is not essential in most of the pieces. The Eight Pieces of Brocade follow a few simple principles, but they will lead the interested practitioner down the right path to discover what qi is all about and will also improve health.

I hope this simple set of qigong practice will help you to have a healthy life, and encourage you to get involved in further qigong study and research. If you have obtained benefit from this set, please introduce it to your friends and help them to improve their health.
