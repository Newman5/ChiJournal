# ChiJournal
A fork of Brad Traversy vanillawebprojects expense-tracker, which I set up to record my ChiGong sessions

# First steps in a larger world
I've always wanted to do this and today is the day.  And, by 'this', I mean, using GitHub to hold on to my projects and record my ideas and maybe get some collaboration.  My goal is to figure out a better workflow than using an FTP program.  

# Steps
- I want to share this code with others.  
- Host it so that others can use it to track chi gong sessions
- find a collaborator (Can GitHub do collab mode coding?)
- learn / use Markdown (currently)
- make a trello board for the app

# toDo for the app

- add map and markers
- sorting of past events so latest is on top (done)
- collecting start and end time
- back up of data from local storage
- chi journal stuff of intention / areas of distress
- add to Github - workflow for updates (currently)
- autofucus of form (done)
- increment by 5 (done)
